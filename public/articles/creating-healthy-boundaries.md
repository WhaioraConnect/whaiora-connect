# Creating Healthy Boundaries: A Guide to Emotional Wellbeing

*Learn to protect your energy, honour your needs, and build relationships that support your wellbeing.*

---

## What Are Boundaries?

Boundaries are the limits you set to protect your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual wellbeing. They define where you end and others begin—what you're comfortable with, what you're not, and what you need to feel safe and respected.

Healthy boundaries aren't walls that keep people out; they're gates that you control, deciding what comes in and what stays out.

## Why Boundaries Matter

Without healthy boundaries:

* You feel drained, resentful, or taken advantage of
* Your needs go unmet while you prioritize others'
* Relationships become one-sided or toxic
* Stress and burnout increase
* Self-esteem suffers
* Physical and mental health decline

With healthy boundaries:

* You have energy for what matters most
* Relationships are more authentic and balanced
* You feel respected and valued
* Stress decreases
* Self-respect grows
* Overall wellbeing improves

## Types of Boundaries

### Physical Boundaries

Relate to your body, personal space, and physical needs.

**Examples:**

* Who can touch you and how
* Your need for personal space
* Sleep and rest requirements
* Physical privacy
* Comfort with physical affection

**Healthy:** "I prefer handshakes to hugs with people I'm not close to."
**Unhealthy:** Allowing unwanted physical contact to avoid awkwardness.

### Emotional Boundaries

Protect your feelings and emotional energy.

**Examples:**

* Not taking responsibility for others' emotions
* Choosing what emotional information to share
* Not accepting blame for things outside your control
* Limiting exposure to others' emotional dumping

**Healthy:** "I care about your feelings, but I can't fix them for you."
**Unhealthy:** Absorbing others' emotions as your own.

### Mental Boundaries

Relate to your thoughts, values, and opinions.

**Examples:**

* Respecting your own beliefs and opinions
* Not allowing others to define your reality
* Choosing what information to take in
* Protecting your thoughts from manipulation

**Healthy:** "I respect your opinion, and I have a different perspective."
**Unhealthy:** Letting others tell you how to think.

### Time Boundaries

Protect how you spend your limited time and energy.

**Examples:**

* Saying no to commitments that don't serve you
* Protecting time for rest and self-care
* Setting work hours and sticking to them
* Limiting time with draining people or activities

**Healthy:** "I need to leave by 8 PM to get enough rest."
**Unhealthy:** Saying yes to everything.

### Material Boundaries

Relate to your possessions and financial resources.

**Examples:**

* Deciding what you'll lend or give
* Setting limits on financial support
* Protecting your belongings
* Choosing how you spend your money

**Healthy:** "I'm not comfortable lending money, but I can help you find other resources."
**Unhealthy:** Lending beyond your means.

## Signs You Need Better Boundaries

* Feeling overwhelmed or burned out
* Resentment toward people you care about
* Saying yes when you want to say no
* Feeling responsible for others' feelings
* Avoiding people who drain your energy
* Physical symptoms of stress
* Feeling guilty when you prioritize yourself
* One-sided relationships
* Your needs consistently go unmet

## How to Set Healthy Boundaries

### 1. Get Clear on Your Needs and Limits

You can't set boundaries if you don't know what they are.

**Practice:**

* Notice when you feel uncomfortable or resentful
* Ask: *“What do I need right now?”*
* Identify your non-negotiables
* Recognize your values and priorities
* Journal about situations where you needed better boundaries

**Questions to ask:**

* What energizes me? What drains me?
* What behaviours am I not okay with?
* What do I need to feel safe and respected?
* Where am I overextending myself?

### 2. Start Small

Setting boundaries feels uncomfortable at first.

Start with:

* Low-stakes situations
* People who generally respect you
* One boundary at a time
* Simple, clear statements

### 3. Be Clear and Direct

**Instead of:**
"Maybe we could spend less time together…"

**Try:**
"I need one evening per week to myself."

**Tips:**

* Use “I” statements
* Be specific
* Keep it simple
* No over-explaining

### 4. Communicate Boundaries Calmly

Speak clearly and respectfully.

**Example:**
"I understand you'd like to talk now, and I need to wait until tomorrow."

### 5. Follow Through Consistently

A boundary without follow-through is a suggestion.

If someone crosses it:

* Restate your boundary
* Enforce the consequence
* Stay consistent

### 6. Prepare for Pushback

People may resist when you start setting boundaries.

**Common reactions:**

* Guilt-tripping
* Minimizing
* Anger
* Bargaining
* Victim-playing

**Your response:**
Stay calm, repeat your boundary. Their reaction is about *them*.

### 7. Deal with Guilt

Feeling guilty is normal.

**Reframe:**
"I'm not being selfish; I'm taking care of myself."

## Boundaries in Different Relationships

### Family

**Examples:**

* "Please call before stopping by."
* "I'm not discussing my finances."
* "I leave when conversations become disrespectful."

### Friendships

* "I need a day's notice for plans."
* "I care about you, but I can't be your only support."

### Work

* "I don't check email after 7 PM."
* "I take my lunch break uninterrupted."

### Romantic Relationships

* "I need alone time to recharge."
* "I'm not comfortable with you checking my phone."

## Cultural Considerations

### Balancing Individual Needs and Collective Culture

In many cultures, including Māori culture, collective wellbeing is central.

**Whanaungatanga** means:

* Caring for others AND yourself
* Contributing from a full cup
* Honouring relationships and personal needs

### Manaakitanga and Boundaries

True care includes caring for yourself.

## When Boundaries Aren't Respected

### Identify Boundary Violators

People who:

* Repeatedly cross boundaries
* Guilt-trip or manipulate
* Become angry at your limits

### Your Options

1. Reassert the boundary
2. Limit contact
3. End the relationship
4. Seek support

### When to Walk Away

Walk away if someone:

* Disrespects boundaries repeatedly
* Becomes abusive
* Makes you feel unsafe
