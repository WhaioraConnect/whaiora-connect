## The Gut-Brain Connection

Your gut and brain are in constant communication through the gut-brain axis—a complex network involving nerves, hormones, and your immune system. In fact, your gut produces about 95% of your body's serotonin, the neurotransmitter often called the "happiness chemical."

What you eat directly affects:
- Neurotransmitter production
- Brain inflammation levels
- Energy and mental clarity
- Mood stability
- Stress response
- Sleep quality

Think of nutrition as daily medicine for your mind.
